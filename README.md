A simple play app that shows different strategies for circuit-breaker, retry, timeout and delay.


| Endpoint                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| GET /timeout/:duration         | This endpoint will timeout based on the `duration` value. `duration` is required and it is of type Long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GET /circuit-breaker           | The first **3** requests will call the `service` function, after that the circuit will go to the open state and any future requests (4th request and above) will fail fast and will not call the `service` function. After 1 minute the circuit will close. Once the circuit is closed the next request will call the `service` but if the `service` function fails again then the circuit will open again. **Note:** The very first time circuit opened after 3 failures but now it will open after just one failure. |
| GET /retry                     | This will retry upto 5 times before returning the response. It will either return `Couldn't get an answer after 5 tries` or `Got answer on try n of 5 [RequestId: 9]`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| GET /delay?sleep=100&delay=200 | This will execute 2 future calls, one future will sleep for `sleep` milliseconds and the other future will be trigger **after** `delay` milliseconds, the first one to complete will be returned as a response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
